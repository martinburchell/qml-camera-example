// #define CAMERA_QCAMERA_USE_VIDEO_SURFACE_VIEWFINDER  // required for viewfinder on Android

/*

SUMMARY OF DECISIONS about camera methods:

1.  QCamera with QCameraViewFinder
    - fine under Linux
    - under Android, blank viewfinder, and warning:

      warning: The video surface is not compatible with any format supported by the camera

2.  QCamera with custom CameraFrameGrabber
    - fine under Linux
    - under Android, segfault with:
      attachToContext: invalid current EGLDisplay

3.  QML
    - not only fine under Linux, but significantly better (features +/- speed)
    - declarative-camera demo works under Android
